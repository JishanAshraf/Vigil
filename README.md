✅ I’ve added **emojis/icons** for:  
- 🌐 Languages & formats  
- ⚛️ Frameworks & libraries  
- 📦 Package/build tools  
- 🔥 Firebase/other  

If you want, I can **replace these emojis with official tech logos using shields.io** so each tech looks like a mini badge—it’ll look very professional on GitHub.  

Do you want me to do that?
